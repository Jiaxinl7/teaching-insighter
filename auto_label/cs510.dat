0,"In information science, entropy is a measure of the amount of information that is contained in a given data set. The higher the entropy, the more information that is contained in the data set. Entropy is typically measured in bits, and can be calculated using the following equation: Entropy = -log2(P), where P is the probability of each event occurring."
1,"Cross entropy is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions. If we have two distributions, P and Q, the cross entropy between them is defined as: H(P,Q) = - \sum_x P(x) \log Q(x). In other words, it's the sum of the negative log probabilities of each event under distribution Q, weighted by the probability of that event under distribution P. The cross entropy can be thought of as a way of quantifying the amount of information that is lost when using distribution Q to approximate distribution P."
2,"Relative entropy is a measure of how different two probability distributions are. If two distributions are identical, the relative entropy is zero. If they are different, the relative entropy is positive. The relative entropy between two distributions P and Q is defined as: D(P||Q) = sum_i P(i) log(P(i)/Q(i)), where i ranges over all possible outcomes."
3,"The conditional entropy of a random variable X given another random variable Y is a measure of the amount of uncertainty in X given that we know the value of Y. It is formally defined as: H(X|Y) = - \sum_{x \in X, y \in Y} p(x,y) \log p(x|y), where p(x,y) is the joint probability distribution of X and Y, and p(x|y) is the conditional probability distribution of X given Y."
4,KL-divergence is a measure of how different two probability distributions are. The KL-divergence between two distributions P and Q is defined as: D_{KL}(P || Q) = \sum_i P(i) \log \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}. This measures the amount of information that is lost when P is approximated by Q.
5,"Mutual information is a measure of the amount of information that two variables share. It is calculated as the amount of information that one variable contains about the other, divided by the total amount of information in both variables. Mutual information can be thought of as a measure of how ""entangled"" two variables are."
6,"A statistical language model is a mathematical model that estimates the probability of a sequence of words. The estimate is based on a training corpus, which is a collection of texts in the same language. The model assigns a probability to each word in the corpus, and then calculates the probability of a new sequence of words based on those probabilities."
7,"A unigram language model is a statistical language model that uses only a single word to predict the next word in a sequence. The unigram language model is the simplest form of statistical language modeling, and is often used as a baseline for more complex models. The unigram language model can be represented by the following equation: P(w_i) = \frac{count(w_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} count(w_j)}, where P(w_i) is the probability of the i-th word in the sequence, count(w_i) is the number of times the i-th word occurs in the training data, and N is the total number of words in the training data."
8,"An N-gram language model is a statistical language model that uses a sequence of N words (an N-gram) to predict the next word in a text or speech. The model estimates the probability of each word in the sequence based on the preceding N-1 words, and uses this information to predict the next word. There are a few assumptions that are made in an N-gram language model. One is that the probability of a word occurring is only dependent on the words that come before it. Another assumption is that all of the words in the corpus are independent of each other."
9,"There are several major types of language models, including statistical language models, rule-based language models, and neural language models."
